## Reflection Document

### HTML

The exercises were mosty self-explanatory, but I referred to the videos for specific content and formatting issues.
All of the exercises were very helful, but specifically the form exercise helped me betterunderstand iput components and elements.
I would have liked more information about the various options for "type." I woud have liked to see all types in action.

### Accessibility

It is important to attribute labels to form elements. Simpy using the label tag with its for attribute matching the element's id, we can eliminate these accessibility issues. This exercise did not require much video support for me. I have not thought
of any exercises that woud help otherthan these.

### CSS

The CSS exercises were very difficut. I needed the videos for a good number of them. However, these exercises
were incrediby helpful. I woud have liked more discussion and exercises involving media queries. Those were
confusing.

### Flexbox

I definitely needed video help completing the Flexbox exercises. However, Flexbox is extremely useful
and seems to address a lot of the difficulties I have had understanding positioning with CSS. I would
have lied to have a more detailed explaination about Flexbox properties. Maybe exercises demonstrating
multiple layouts would have been helpful.

### Bootstrap
